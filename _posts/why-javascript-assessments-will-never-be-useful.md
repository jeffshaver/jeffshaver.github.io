title: Why JavaScript assessments will never be helpful
---

A friend of mine, who is just finishing up college, said that he feels like he has to memorize things about programming languages because he thinks he would look stupid if he has to Google something while at work.

Him mentioning this made me remember some conversations I have had and occasionally am still forced to have when searching for my next opportunity:

Me: "I finished that assessment you requested. The questions were... odd" (Even though I really want to say that I do not want to work for a company who thinks passing this assessment means that I am competent at writing JavaScript.)

Recruiter: "Really? I feel like I hear that every time someone takes the assessment."

Well... There is a reason for that...

The reason that you hear that is that the test doesn't really assess anything relevant. It just assesses your ability to memorize things. Don't get me wrong -- the ability to memorize things in programming is useful. However, sometimes it just doesn't matter. If I know 10 programming languages, it doesn't mean that I have to memorize every single detail about every single idiosyncrasy in every single programming language I know. We have the internet now... If there is something that I have to or want to do and I don't know exactly how to do it, I can look it up if I have to. And usually, within a couple minutes, I know the answer.

It is okay to look things up! It is okay to Google something if you forget it. Sometimes I forget the subtle differences between a strings `substr`, `substring` and `splice` methods, but that doesn't make me incompetent.

I guess the moral here, I guess, is that being able to memorize answers is good, but knowing how to find the answers is just as good.
